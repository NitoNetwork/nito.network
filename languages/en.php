						<p>Nito stands out as the leading platform, designed with a focus on decentralization, efficiency, and security. Utilizing a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Nito ensures robust security and fairness by allowing anyone with the necessary hardware to participate in the mining process. This democratizes the network, preventing centralization and promoting true decentralization.</p><br>
						<p>Nito\'s blockchain system is engineered for high transaction throughput with a one-minute block interval and a 0.8 MB block weight, which can be increased for higher transaction output if needed. This results in fast and efficient transaction processing, essential for merchants needing rapid confirmations. Additionally, Nito uses Bech32, making transactions more efficient by reducing transaction size and lowering costs.</p><br>
						<p>The economic model of Nito is built for long-term sustainability. With a total supply of 1,154,217,600 Nitos distributed over 200 years, Nito maintains steady and predictable growth. Real time difficulty adjustment further ensure network stability and security. Notably, Nito has no pre-mine, guaranteeing fair distribution from the beginning.</p>',
